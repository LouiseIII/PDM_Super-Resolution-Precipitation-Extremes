# Interpretable Super-Resolution of Hourly Precipitation Extremes over Swizterland Repository

## Overview

This repository addresses a Super-Resolution downscaling case for hourly extreme precipitation data during the summer season from 1999 to 2009. The project explores various resolutions (24, 48, and 72 km) and different time periods (present and future 2079-2089). The repository contains only the essential main codes for the project and does not include all explorations conducted during its course.

## Repository Structure

- **data/**: Contains a small subset of the data to provide an idea of the source data.
- **dev/**: Contains the main codes necessary for the project.
- **outputs/**: Includes short example outputs as excerpts.

## Notes

Most scripts (for visualizations or other purposes) contain only the codes related to the downscaling model targeting a resolution change from 12 km to 2 km. The other scripts are constructed similarly.
